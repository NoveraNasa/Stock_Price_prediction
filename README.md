Stock Price Prediction Project using TensorFlow

*Last Updated: 26 May, 2024*

---
In this project, we aim to predict stock prices using TensorFlow, a powerful open-source framework for machine learning and deep learning. Stock market price analysis involves time series forecasting, making recurrent neural networks (RNNs) particularly well-suited for this task. TensorFlow simplifies the implementation of RNNs, enabling us to build sophisticated models with ease.

Importing Libraries and Dataset

Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and TensorFlow streamline the process of handling data and performing complex analysis tasks. We load the dataset into a Pandas dataframe, which facilitates data manipulation and analysis.

Context

The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices for companies listed on the S&P 500 index over the last five years. It offers valuable insights for analyzing stock market trends and building predictive models.

Here we worked only on Google stock price over time. We try to build a model that can predict future data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is crucial for gaining insights into the data and identifying patterns. Visualization techniques help us understand the distribution of stock prices over time and explore relationships between different variables.

Building Gated RNN-LSTM Network using TensorFlow

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are a type of RNN widely used for sequence modeling and time series prediction. TensorFlow provides convenient tools for creating LSTM-based models. We stack multiple LSTM layers and use the `return_sequences=True` parameter to maintain sequence output.

Model Compilation and Training

When compiling the model, we specify essential parameters such as the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. We optimize the cost function using gradient descent, monitor model performance with the loss function, and evaluate predictions using metrics.

Model Evaluation and Visualization

After training the model, we evaluate its performance on testing data and visualize the predictions against actual stock prices. Visualization aids in understanding the model's accuracy and identifying areas for improvement.

This project demonstrates how TensorFlow can be leveraged to build robust stock price prediction models, offering insights that can inform investment decisions and financial strategies.
